I am a Heilbronn Research Fellow at the University of Manchester. Broadly, I study group theory.

I am currently interested in local group theory, specifically through the lens of saturated fusion systems over p-groups and their interactions with group amalgams. In fusion systems, my current research focuses on recognizing the p-fusion categories of simple groups of Lie type from prescribed local actions. 

Alongside this, I am interested in exotic fusion systems at odd primes, and the applications of fusion systems to representation theory and homotopy theory.
